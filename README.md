# Big Integer Arithmetic in C

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Overview

This repository contains a C program for performing arithmetic operations on large integers, commonly referred to as "big integers" or "arbitrary-precision integers." Big integers allow you to work with extremely large numbers that exceed the range of standard data types, making them suitable for applications like cryptography, numerical simulations, and more.

The C program provided here offers a collection of functions for performing the following big integer operations:

- **Addition**
- **Subtraction**
- **Multiplication**
- **Division**
- **Modulo (Remainder)**
