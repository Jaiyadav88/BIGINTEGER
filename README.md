# Big Integer Arithmetic in C

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Overview

This repository contains a C program for performing arithmetic operations on large integers, commonly referred to as "big integers" or "arbitrary-precision integers." Big integers allow you to work with extremely large numbers that exceed the range of standard data types, making them suitable for applications like cryptography, numerical simulations, and more.

The C program provided here offers a collection of functions for performing the following big integer operations:

- **Addition**
- **Subtraction**
- **Multiplication**
- **Division**
- **Modulo (Remainder)**

## Features

- **Single Program, Multiple Operations**: The C program, `biginteger.c`, combines all the big integer operations into one file for ease of use.
- **Flexible Usage**: Easily integrate the program into your C projects to work with large integers.
- **Code**: The directory includes sample C programs demonstrating how to use the `biginteger.c` program for various arithmetic operations.
- **Contributions Welcome**: Contributions and improvements to the code are encouraged. Feel free to submit pull requests to enhance functionality, optimize 
  performance, or improve code quality.

## Usage

To use the `bigint.c` program for big integer arithmetic, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Include `bigint.c` in your C project.

3. In your project, include the header file `Arithmetic.h` and call the functions for the desired arithmetic operations.

4. The code is designed to handle large integers, ensuring accurate results for various arithmetic operations.

5.This file does not contain main function, feel free to import your main function and use it as per your choice
